## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the full project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

The project is built in yarn at frontend and npm for backend.

* **Npm** is distributed with Node.js which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

* **Yarn** is a package manager built by Facebook Team and seems to be faster than npm in general.  [Download Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

1. cd infra
2. docker-compose up -d --build // to build
